## Overview

This project focuses on a statistical analysis of various key metrics that impacts the overall sales of a certain fictitious store. We received one year data with daily granularity of the store to perform the analysis. 

The repository directory structure is as follows:

Sales-Statistical-Analysis<br>
├─ 01_DATABASE<br>
├─ 02_ANALYSIS<br>
├─ RESOURCES<br>

The type of content present in the directories is as follows:

**01_DATABASE**

This directory has the database that we are going to use. We have a SQL script that we can run to get the database ready.

> The SQL flavor used in the SQL script is **pgSQL**

**02_ANALYSIS**

This directory contains the SQL Notebook that performs the analysis of the data and provides insight.

> The SQL Notebooks are basically the `.ipynb` files with SQL kernel and can be edited through Azure Data Studio (ADS)

> The SQL flavor used in the solution queries is **pgSQL**

**RESOURCES**

This directory contains images, icons, layouts, etc. that are used in this project.

## Credits
